**Python | Time Series Analysis**
â—¾ Framed sensor relationships as shifting patterns to support stakeholder sensemaking and surface practical questions to investigate.
â—¾ Identified correlation drift, flagging 17 anomalous days; global % Iron vs % Silica correlation was âˆ’0.80 while June 1 fell to âˆ’0.27, indicating a clear deviation.
â—¾ Produced Pearson correlation line plots and hour-by-hour time series visualizations to inform predictive model and dashboard design.
