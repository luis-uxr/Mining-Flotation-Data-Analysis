# Mining-Flotation-Data-Analysis
Exploratory Python analysis of 737,453 time-stamped sensor records from a flotation plant to help engineering stakeholders explain and anticipate operational anomalies.

**Python | Time Series Analysis**
◾ Framed sensor relationships as shifting patterns to support stakeholder sensemaking and surface practical questions to investigate.
◾ Identified correlation drift, flagging 17 anomalous days; global % Iron vs % Silica correlation was −0.80 while June 1 fell to −0.27, indicating a clear deviation.
◾ Produced Pearson correlation line plots and hour-by-hour time series visualizations to inform predictive model and dashboard design.
